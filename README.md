# SubwayDash

Hello, this is the source code for my endless runner game SubwayDash. The actual title of the game is Chikatetsu Dashu but was translated to English. This is the first game I ever made. You can to go to the github pages page that hosts this so you can play. Here is the link: https://jesushernandezflores.github.io/SubwayDash/

If the website doesn't work feel free to email me at jesus@jesushf.dev and let me know. The game for sure works on Chrome browser and I think it should work on all other browsers. 

I have concluded that this game is rubbish and I am recreating it in Unity 2D. You can find the repo on this github account as well
